Automated Molecular Detection System for Pine Wood Nematodes

Model: SLBX-50 
Brand: Howard Lee 

I. Product Introduction: 
The SLBX-50 Automated Molecular Detection System for Pine Wood Nematodes is an instrument specially designed by Howard TechPulse Commerce Inc for workers in forestry and commodity inspection systems to quickly and accurately detect pine wood nematodes. With its excellent performance and portability, it enables you to obtain more accurate and effective detection results in a shorter time. 

II. Product Performance: 
Detection throughput: 48-well 2-color fluorescence detection, each tube can detect 2 items at the same time, which greatly improves the experimental efficiency and avoids the inconvenience caused by repeated sample addition for detection. - Temperature control: The maximum heating rate is up to 8℃/s, the maximum cooling rate is up to 6.1℃/s, and a standard PCR amplification program can be completed in only 30 minutes; the temperature accuracy is controlled within ±0.1℃; ensuring good repeatability and accuracy. - Fluorescence scanning: It takes only 2 seconds to complete all 48-well 2-color fluorescence scanning, which can significantly reduce the overall experimental time for users who need to use the High-Resolution Melting (HRM) curve function, greatly improving work efficiency. Easy operation: - Full English system interface and guided parameter setting, after simple training, you can master the use of the instrument and have the ability to operate the experiment independently. Powerful data processing: - In addition to conventional analysis functions such as relative quantification, absolute quantification, HRM, and SNP, it is also compatible with fluorescence analysis functions of various amplification technologies, allowing you to not only quickly and automatically detect pine wood nematode molecules but also develop a variety of biological gene detection, realizing a truly multi-purpose machine. - In addition to the instrument operation software, it is also equipped with an independent data management software, which can realize centralized management, statistics, and analysis of a large number of user's experimental data, avoiding the previous step of manual complex analysis of raw data. Excellent environmental adaptability: - Adopting a fixed fluorescence detection unit, no calibration is required after moving, and it can be directly turned on for operation. Application fields: Import and export quarantine Forestry and forest protection departments Rapid food safety detection Public health on-site detection Small and medium-sized scientific research laboratories.
