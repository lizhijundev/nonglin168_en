II. Precautions for Automated Molecular Detection System for Pine Wood Nematodes 
1) The instrument must be placed on a stable indoor workbench, without direct strong light, free from strong electromagnetic field interference, no electrical equipment generating high-frequency waves nearby, and in a non-destructive environment; 
2) Environmental requirements for the instrument during operation: temperature between 5～40℃; humidity not greater than 80%; normal atmospheric pressure (altitude below 2000 meters); 
3) No corrosive gases and organic and inorganic gases with absorption in the ultraviolet range in the environment; 
4) Power supply voltage: AC120×(1±10%)V, frequency 60Hz; Note: If the power supply in the area where the instrument is used is often unstable or too high or too low, the user is required to be equipped with an AC voltage stabilizer greater than 1100W, and avoid plugging other electrical equipment on the same main line of the power supply. 
5) The power socket used by the instrument must be safely grounded, and the socket must be stable and have reliable contact; 
6) Please read the user manual carefully before use; 
7) If the equipment is not operated in the manner specified by the manufacturer, it may damage the protection provided by the equipment.
